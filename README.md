# Overview

The rising emissions of greenhouse gasses has driven earth to an uncofortable state of climate change. Our new app vessel aims to use the power of composting to reduce greeenhouse gasses and put carbon back into the ground. About one forth of American waste is organic material that can be composted yet only eight percent of people use compost. Compost is the key to sustainable agriculture due to its properties with water retention, waste reduction, and soil health.

The landing page gives users the ability to drop their compost at one of vessel's drop-off locations. Each of the company's drop-off locations will consist of a recycled shipping container split into three different compartments for different stages in the composting process. When the user deposits their waste, an automated system will weight the scraps and then add it to the compost pile. The vessel will then scan an in-app QR code so the user can be reimbured with points.

The points given to users can either be withdrawn for money or used to buy vessel brand compost. This money comes from the revenue of the finished compost. With organic compost selling at nearly ten cents per pound, the vessel compost can will make enough money to incentivise each user to turn their trash into treasure.
